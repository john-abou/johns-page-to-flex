# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
My motivation for making this page was to showcase some of the new skills I learned and start hosting all of my work in a portfolio I can show future employers. I intend to keep this page up to date with all of my most recent projects and improve it as I continue to learn. It's going to be a valuable asset in my future job search as a junior fullstack dev. 

I learned more about the flexbox model and was able to make my page responsive on my own. Also, I learned more about how I prefer to organize my code, when styling with CSS I prefer to have the code follow the general order of the HTML file. For example, start with the universal selectors then move to the header, body, etc. 

I also learned that making a webpage responsive on multiple screensizes is good practice to practice all the tools we learned. (HTML, CSS, flexbox, media queries, etc.) But it's incredibly exhausting. 

## Deployment
